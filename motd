===================================================

Ensure your KSP directory is mounted to /kerbal;
This can be done by adding this docker argument:
--mount type=bind,source=/path/to/ksp,target=/kerbal

GUI commands require x11docker or an exposed X-Server.
Execute ckan commands against the mounted KSP directory
by issuing 'ckan' followed by your ckan arguments.
